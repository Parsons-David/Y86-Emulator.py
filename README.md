# Y86-Emulator.py

Python port of the C Y86-Emulator Developed for Rutgers CS 211 Computer Architecture.

This emulator has the same functionality as my C Y86-Emulator.

The intention of creating this repository was to learn more about Python and practice more with the concepts associated with Y86.
